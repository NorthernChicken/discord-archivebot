# DISCLAIMERS
* This bot requires Administrator on your Discord server. This is a dangerous permission to give out. I am not doing anything malicious, but please check my code for yourself, don't take my word for it.
* Do not use this bot for malicious purposes, and only archive a server with the server member's consent.
